The files contain the data and calculations used in the paper, as follows.  GCRfibroCA9.18.2017.Rmd is the main file for the paper's chromosome aberration (CA) sections; CAsynergyGH.R is an excerpt; HGsynergyMain.R is for the murine Harderian gland (HG) sections; all other files are minor and/or are for the supplementary information to the paper. 
These scripts can generate the data-based figures in the paper.
