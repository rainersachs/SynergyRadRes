# SynergyRadRes
Scripts for the main calculations in synergy MS (Dae Woong Ham et al.) submitted to Radiation Research.
The files contain the data and calculations used in the paper, as follows.  GCRfibroCA.Rmd is the main file for the paper's chromosome aberration (CA) sections; HGsynergyMain.R is for the murine Harderian gland (HG) high charge high energy (HZE) ions, which are also high linear energy transfer; all other files are comparatively minor and/or are for the supplementary information to the paper. 
Scripts will need to be added, updated, clarified (especially the commenting) and shortened according to reviewers' and editors' comments as the review process unfolds and after publication. Scripts can be downloaded, modified, and used (cost-free, as is) to facilitate independent evaluation of the paper's conclusions; the only restrictions are given by the license file here and are about as lenient as any open-source license.
