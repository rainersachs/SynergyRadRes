# SynergyRadRes
Scripts for the main calculations in synergy MS (Dae Woong Ham et al.) submitted to Radiation Research.
The files contain the data and calculations used in the paper, as follows.  GCRfibroCA.Rmd is the main file for the paper's chromosome aberration (CA) sections; HGsynergyMain.R is for the murine Harderian gland (HG) high charge high energy (HZE) ions, which are also high linear energy transfer; all other files are minor and/or are for the supplementary information to the paper. 
These scripts can generate the data-based figures in the paper. 
The scripts, especially the commenting, will need to be updated, clarified and shortened according to reviewers' and editors' comments as the review process unfolds and after publication.
