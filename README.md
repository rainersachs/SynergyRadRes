# SynergyRadRes
Scripts for the main calculations in synergy MS (Dae Woong Ham et al.) accepted for publication November 2017 by Radiation Research.
Scripts can be downloaded, modified, and used (cost-free, as is) to facilitate independent evaluation of the paper's conclusions. The only restrictions, given by the license file here, essentially say that users cannot hijack the scripts by making them proprietory but otherwise can use them however is convenient. 
We suggest that full source-code transparency among different, wholly independent research groups is essential to enable modelers in this interdisciplinary field to correct each others' mistakes, thereby reaching a fact-based consensus that deserves to be taken seriously rather than numerous over-optimistic pictures, each one concerning a single group's results.
The files contain the data and calculations used in the paper, as follows.  GCRfibroCA.Rmd is the main file for the paper's chromosome aberration (CA) sections; HGsynergyMain.R is for modeling the murine Harderian gland (HG) data; protractedLQ1-ionAndSynergyAnalysis.R is for low dose rate in Supplementary Information A4. Script commenting will be improved as time permits.
